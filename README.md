A simple and fun Python game where you guess a number between 1 and 10. Great for beginners to practice input handling, loops, conditionals, and exception handling.

# Number Guessing Game (Beginner Python Project)

A simple console-based number guessing game built with Python. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 10, and the player tries to guess it.

## Features

- Random number generation using the `random` module
- User input handling with `input()`
- Conditional logic for checking guesses
- Looping to allow multiple attempts
- Exception handling for invalid (non-integer) inputs

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

- Basics of Python programming
- Working with conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Using `try-except` blocks for error handling
- Building interactive CLI-based programs
- Using `while` loops and control flow

## How to Run the Game

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the `.py` file.
